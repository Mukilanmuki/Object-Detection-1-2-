# YOLOv8 Object Detection Model for Hand Signs Recognition
This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv8 for detecting hand signs representing the numbers 1 and 2. The model is imported from Ultralytics and trained on a custom dataset generated from Roboflow.

Features
Object Detection: Detects hand signs indicating numbers 1 and 2 in images.
YOLOv8 Implementation: Utilizes YOLOv8 architecture for efficient and accurate object detection.
Custom Dataset: Trained on a custom dataset prepared using Roboflow for specific hand sign recognition.
